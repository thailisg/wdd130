            <p>This is the city where I was born. It's known as "The Land of Eternal Spring" because its climate is spring-like year-round. It was founded in 1588 and has a rich historical heritage. It's a city of adventurers, offering hiking, mountain climbing, and many other extreme sports. It's the land where I was born, and a very beautiful place.</p>
